2024-03-14T15:48:35.9545678-03:00 [WRN] (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Model.Validation) The property '"ID_CONCESSAO"' on entity type '"CONCESSAO"' is of type 'byte', but is set up to use a SQL Server identity column; this requires that values starting at 255 and counting down will be used for temporary key values. A temporary key value is needed for every entity inserted in a single call to 'SaveChanges'. Care must be taken that these values do not collide with real key values.
